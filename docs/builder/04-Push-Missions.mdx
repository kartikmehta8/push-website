## What are Push Missions?

‚òùüèº A Push Mission is an exciting way to both contribute to the growth of Push Protocol, as well as earn rewards. These missions are effectively challenges that involve solving technical or brand awareness tasks.

If you successfully complete a mission, you earn $PUSH token rewards. Simple!

Missions are classified into two big categories:
- **Technical missions**
- **Brand awareness missions**

Push Missions are open on a rolling basis.

To participate in the program:

- Make a post on Twitter using the hashtag `#PushMissions`
- Make sure to tag `@pushprotocol` and `@push_DAO`
- Submit your application through the form listed above

Our team will review applications on a rolling basis. Applicants will be notified via email whether your mission is accomplished or not. We will contact you if more information is required and we might even schedule a call with the team if necessary. We may return with further questions or suggestions at that point. We expect to receive many applications and will work as quickly as possible to process them.

Please read all the details mentioned in the card and submit your work:
